# Tic Tac Toe
This is a basic minimax algorithm employed to play and win tic-tac-toe games.

My friend and I thought it would be interesting if we both created an AI, and then played them against each other. In the end, as long the opponent is playing optimally, the game always results in a tie, or "cat's game".

#### Possible Features:
- Rework the minimax algorithm to use the negamax algorithm.
- Create a version of the algorithm which can play [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe).

## How it Works
It currently is not applied to a project, but for fun I might plug it into a tic-tac-toe site and let poeple play online. I think by the nature of the algorithm, different difficulties can be chosen.

## About
The project was created with Typescript.
